This approach is ideal for those who want to manually set up their clusters with full control over the environment.\nPrerequisites Before you begin, ensure the following:\nTwo or more nodes: You will need at least one master node and one worker node. These can be physical or virtual machines. Linux-based OS: Ubuntu 20.04 or CentOS 7/8 is preferred for compatibility. Root/Sudo privileges: Ensure you have root or sudo privileges on all nodes. Swap is disabled: Kubernetes recommends disabling swap on all nodes. Firewall settings: Allow communication between the nodes over specific ports (e.g., 6443, 10250, 10251, 10252, etc.). Step 1: Prepare the Nodes 1.1 Update the System On all nodes (master and worker), run the following commands to update the system:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade -y 1.2 Install required packages: sudo apt install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/hugo-PaperMod/posts/kubernetes/","summary":"Kubernetes Cluster Setup with Kubeadm Date: 2024-12-21T20:53:29+07:00\nDraft: true\nIntroduction In this guide, I will walk you through setting up a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster using kubeadm, a tool that simplifies the process of creating Kubernetes clusters.
