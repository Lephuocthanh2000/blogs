## Introduction to Kubernetes

In this post, we will explore Kubernetes, an open-source platform for automating containerized application deployment, scaling, and management.

### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as K8s) is a powerful container orchestration tool that helps you manage applications that are containerized using Docker or other container runtimes. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications across clusters of hosts.

### Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes allows you to manage containerized applications at scale with high availability, fault tolerance, and zero downtime. It provides features like automatic scaling, self-healing, load balancing, and rolling updates.
